# planwithus

Web application for advanced module planning. View the [WIP demo](https://planwithus.netlify.app/) and the [library](https://github.com/wei2912/planwithus-lib) containing the course requirements specification and verification logic.

Inspired by [NUSMods](https://nusmods.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in the development mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

## Deployment

Builds pushed to the `main` branch are automatically built and pushed to [Netlify](https://planwithus.netlify.app/).
